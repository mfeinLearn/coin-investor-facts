                            ,  c2    ,

Users can signup, log in, logout, create Investment entries, edit their own entries, and
view their entries

# Stretch Goals

- CSS - make it look really nice
- Tests
- Include a join model
- Include a Investment model - users have different Investments and a Investment has many Entries
- Include a  (user_investments)
- Users can see update news regarding regulation in the layout
